A new type of Critter has appeared.
CupidCritter:
	Will look at its 4 neighbors only. (directly ahead, to the back of, to the right and to the left of Cupid)
	Will choose randomly whether to look up-down or sideways first.
	If there are Actors (to the right && to the left) || (upwards && downwards), then
	the pair will be turned pink (or red) and Cupid will switch locations with one of the members of the couple
	(doesn't matter which member, can be random).

TestCases:
	1. Cupid has no neighbors or 1 member or 2 members but they're not across from one another:
	    --> nothing should be performed, he should just take one move forward/turn
	    2.
	    x A x   or  x x x    ---->  x C x   or   x x x
	    x C x       A C A           x A x        A A C
	    x A x       x x x           x A x        x x x
		   
Illustrated above are the couples and their end positions after the move.
x = empty space or other critters or flowers( doesn't really matter what the space is occupied by)
